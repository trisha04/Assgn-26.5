There are 2 types of tables in Hive,
Internal and External.
Internal table
Internal table are like normal database table where data can be stored and queried on.
On dropping these tables the data stored in them also gets deleted and data is lost forever.

Open new terminal and fire up hive by just typing hive. 
Create table on weather data. 
ROW FORMAT should have delimiters used to terminate the fields and lines like in the above example
the fields are terminated with comma (“,”). 
The default location of Hive table is overwritten by using LOCATION. So the data now is stored in data/weather folder inside hive.

either from local file or from HDFS to Hive.
To load the data from local to Hive use the following command  External Tables
